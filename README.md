Deep playground is an interactive visualization of neural networks, written in typescript using d3.js.
We use github issues for tracking new requests and bugs. Your feedback is highly appreciated!

**If you'd like to contribute, be sure to review the [contribution
guidelines](CONTRIBUTING).**

## Development

To run the visualization locally you just need a server to serve all the files from the `dist` directory. You can run `npm install` then `npm run serve` if you don't have one handy. To see the visualization, visit `http://localhost:8080/` on your browser.

When developing, use `npm run serve-watch`. This will start a static server and also watchers to automatically compile the typescript, html and css files
whenever they change.

To produce a minified javascript file for production, run `npm run build`.

To push to production: `git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages`.

This is not an official Google product.
